            <div id="about">
                <p>I'm Bedagya Raj Joshi, a programmer from Kathmandu, Nepal. My fascination with computers began way back in school, where I gravitated towards math, science, and especially the practical side of things – programming.</p>
                <p>
                    Fueled by a passion for critical thinking and problem-solving, I love the challenge of untangling complex issues and finding creative solutions. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled Ethical Hacker/Cyber Security Specialist, leveraging my coding skills to make the digital world a safer place.  In the meantime, I'm constantly honing my craft as a software engineer, and there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of bringing an idea to life through code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coffee is my constant companion on this coding journey – it fuels those late nights where I lose track of time, completely engrossed in the world of programming and scripting languages. They're not just tools for me, they're a form of creative expression.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1 style="padding-left: 15vw">How I started my IT journey</h1>
                <p>From a young age, the inner workings of technology fascinated me. I was the kid who took apart electronics at home, meticulously putting them back together just to understand how they ticked. This curiosity followed me as I got my first phone, where I tinkered endlessly with software and apps. Upgrading to a PC was a revelation – the sheer power and capabilities ignited a deep desire to learn their secrets.</p>
                <p>
                    School played a pivotal role in this journey. A basic QBasic class sparked a fire within me. The logic behind the code clicked instantly, a secret language for the computer to understand. Soon, I was writing code beyond the curriculum, reveling in the problem-solving power it offered. My natural aptitude for math and critical thinking fueled my passion further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vast world of programming initially seemed overwhelming with its diverse languages. But a key realization emerged: the core logic remained the same, just dressed in different syntax. This understanding fueled my love for coding even more. I devoured new languages and delved deeper into the world of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security emerged as a natural extension of my interests. With limited resources, I tackled the challenge head-on. Python became my weapon of choice, its efficiency resonating with me. While others relied on graphical interfaces, I thrived in the command line, crafting Python scripts to automate daily tasks. The thrill of spending hours to create code that saved minutes, the satisfaction of building something flawless on my own – these experiences honed my skills and solidified my desire for this path. Linux became my preferred environment, fostering a deeper understanding of security and development workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm actively expanding my knowledge base, currently mastering DevOps and networking to become a well-rounded professional. My journey continues, fueled by the same insatiable curiosity that ignited it all.

                    <p>For my Bachelors I took BCA as my course where I am learning more about Software Development and Programming. This is the time when I broadern my knownledge about programming languages, software development and deployement. I learned various languages like JAVA, C#, C++, Python. I also practiced Linux, Advanced Python and Bash Scripts during my free time while studing for my courses as well.
